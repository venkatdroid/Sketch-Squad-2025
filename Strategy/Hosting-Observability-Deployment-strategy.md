## Hosting, Observability, and Deployment strategy

This document outlines key considerations for hosting, deploying, and observing the Interview Accelerator System (IAS). These choices are guided by the system's event-driven, microservices architecture ([ADR-04](/ADR/ADR-04-Adopting%20a%20Three-System%20Architecture%20with%20EDA%20and%20Microservices.md)) and aim to directly support the prioritized architectural characteristics: Performance, Maintainability, and Extensibility, alongside essential non-functional requirements like Resilience and Security ([ADR-03](/ADR/ADR-03-Selecting%20Core%20Architectural%20Characteristics.md)).

## 1. Hosting Environment

**Cloud Platform**: A **public cloud platform** is strongly recommended for its managed services, scalability, and global reach, facilitating Performance and Extensibility.

**Region Strategy**: Initial deployment in a region close to the primary user base is crucial for optimizing Performance (reducing latency). Design should allow for future multi-region deployment (Extensibility).

**Multi-AZ Deployment**: Utilize multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within the chosen region(s) for high availability (Resilience) of compute, databases, and the event streaming platform, which indirectly supports Maintainability by reducing downtime impact.

## 2. Compute and Orchestration

**Containerization**: Package microservices (IMS, Chatbot, Analytics) as containers for consistent environments and simplified deployments, enhancing Maintainability.

**Container Orchestration**: Employ a container orchestration platform to manage deployment, scaling, networking, service discovery, and self-healing. Orchestration is key for:

- **Performance**: Enables automated scaling based on load.

- **Maintainability**: Automates operational tasks and standardizes deployment.

- **Extensibility**: Simplifies adding or updating services independently.

**Serverless Functions (Consideration)**: Evaluate using serverless functions for specific, event-triggered, or stateless tasks (e.g., webhook handlers, small ETL jobs) where their auto-scaling and pay-per-use model align with Performance and cost objectives.

## 3. Deployment Strategy & Automation

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define and manage all infrastructure using IaC principles and tools. This ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control, significantly improving Maintainability and supporting Extensibility by making infrastructure changes manageable.

**CI/CD Pipelines**: Implement robust, automated CI/CD pipelines for building, testing (unit, integration, contract), security scanning, and deploying services. Automation is fundamental for Maintainability and enables rapid, reliable delivery of new features (Extensibility).

**Deployment Patterns**: Utilize strategies like Rolling Updates, Blue/Green, or Canary Releases to deploy updates with minimal downtime and risk, supporting Maintainability (safer releases) and continuous delivery required for Extensibility.

## 4. Networking and Security

**Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Isolate the application network within a secure VPC using subnets for different tiers.

**API Gateway**: Implement an API Gateway as the single entry point for external traffic. This enhances Extensibility (providing a stable interface), Maintainability (centralizing cross-cutting concerns like AuthN/AuthZ, rate limiting), and Security.

**Secrets Management**: Utilize a dedicated secrets management solution for securely handling API keys, credentials, etc., crucial for Security and Maintainability.

**Network Policies/Firewalls**: Enforce least-privilege network access between services for security.

## 5. Scalability & Elasticity

**Horizontal Scaling**: Design services (especially IMS, Chatbot) to be stateless where possible. Leverage the orchestrator's auto-scaling capabilities based on metrics to meet Performance demands dynamically.

**Managed Services Scaling**: Utilize managed services for databases, caches, and the event streaming platform that offer built-in scaling capabilities to handle varying loads and support Performance.

## 6. Resilience & High Availability

**Redundancy**: Deploy critical components across multiple AZs (as mentioned in Hosting).

**Health Checks & Self-Healing**: Implement proper health checks (liveness, readiness) enabling the orchestrator to manage container lifecycles and ensure service availability (supports Maintainability by reducing manual intervention).

**Failure Isolation**: The microservices architecture aims to isolate failures. Implement patterns like Circuit Breakers, Retries, and Timeouts for inter-service and external communication to prevent cascading failures (essential for Resilience and impacts Maintainability).

## 7. Observability (Critical for Top 3 Characteristics)

**Comprehensive Monitoring**: Implement metrics collection for application performance (latency, error rates, throughput - **key for Performance**) and infrastructure utilization. Use dashboards for visualization.

**Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all services and infrastructure into a centralized system using structured logging. Essential for debugging and **Maintainability**.

**Distributed Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing to track requests across microservices and the event stream. Crucial for understanding system behavior, diagnosing Performance issues, and debugging complex flows (**Maintainability**).

**Alerting**: Configure proactive alerts based on metrics and logs for critical issues impacting **Performance** or indicating failures relevant to **Maintainability**.

## 8. Cost Management

Implement **_resource tagging, monitoring, right-sizing, and budget alerts as standard operational practice_** supporting overall Maintainability and efficient resource use.
