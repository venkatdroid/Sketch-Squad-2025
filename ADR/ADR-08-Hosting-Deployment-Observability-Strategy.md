# ADR-08: Hosting, Deployment & Observability Strategy

## Date:

2025-04-03

## Status:

Accepted

## Context:

The Interview Accelerator System (IAS) is designed as an event-driven, microservices-based system (ADR-04) integrating with several external COTS products (ADR-02). A clear strategy is required for hosting the system components (IMS, Chatbot, Analytics, etc.), deploying updates reliably, and ensuring adequate observability. This strategy must align with the prioritized architectural characteristics: Performance, Maintainability, and Extensibility, as well as other key NFRs like Resilience and Security (ADR-03).

## Decision:

We will adopt a cloud-native approach leveraging managed services and automation best practices:

**Hosting**: Utilize a Public Cloud Platform, deploying initially into a suitable region (close to primary users for Performance) across Multiple Availability Zones (for Resilience).

**Compute & Orchestration**: Package applications as Containers and manage them using a Container Orchestration platform. This supports Maintainability (standardization, automation), Extensibility (independent service deployment/scaling), and Performance (elastic scaling). Consider Serverless Functions for suitable event-driven or stateless workloads.

**Deployment & Automation**: Implement automated CI/CD Pipelines for builds, testing, and deployments. Manage infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. Employ standard deployment patterns (e.g., Rolling Updates, Blue/Green) to minimize downtime. This enhances Maintainability (repeatability, consistency) and Extensibility (managing changes, faster releases).

**Networking & Security**: Deploy within a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with appropriate network segmentation. Utilize an API Gateway for managing external access (supporting Extensibility, Maintainability, Security) and a Secrets Management solution.

**Scalability**: Leverage the orchestrator's horizontal auto-scaling capabilities and choose scalable managed services for databases, caches, and the event stream to meet Performance requirements.

**Resilience**: Rely on orchestrator features (health checks, self-healing) and multi-AZ deployments. Implement application-level resilience patterns (e.g., circuit breakers, retries) for inter-service and external communication.

**Observability**: Implement a comprehensive observability strategy encompassing Centralized Logging, Metrics Monitoring, and Distributed Tracing. This is critical for understanding system behavior, diagnosing issues (Maintainability), and identifying bottlenecks (Performance).

**Cost Management**: Employ standard cloud cost management practices (tagging, monitoring, right-sizing).

## Alternatives Considered:

| **Alternative**                                | **Rationale for Rejection**                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| On-Premise Data Center / Private Cloud Hosting | Higher operational burden managing infrastructure, slower provisioning/scaling, less access to diverse managed services, potentially higher TCO, less agility for Extensibility.   |
| VM-based Deployment (No Orchestration)         | Less efficient resource utilization, complex manual scaling, inconsistent environments, slower deployments, harder to manage microservices (impacts Performance, Maintainability). |
| Manual Deployment Processes                    | Error-prone, slow, inconsistent, hinders rapid iteration and feedback cycles, significantly impacts Maintainability and velocity needed for Extensibility.                         |
| Siloed / Basic Monitoring                      | Inadequate for diagnosing issues in a distributed system, hinders Performance optimization and troubleshooting (Maintainability).                                                  |
