## **Status**

Accepted

## Context

When designing the MindCompute interview scheduling system, it is essential to establish guiding architectural characteristics that align with business and technical priorities. Given the nature of our system, we need to focus on aspects that ensure reliability, flexibility, and ease of evolution rather than purely optimizing for scalability.

## Decision

We have identified the following **top architectural characteristics** as critical to our system design:

1. **Performance** – Optimizing for low-latency interactions and efficient processing.

2. **Extensibility** – Enabling future enhancements without major refactoring.

3. **Maintainability** – Ensuring ease of debugging, testing, and operational support.

4. **Resilience** – Designing for fault tolerance and graceful failure handling.

5. **Security** – Ensuring secure handling of sensitive candidate and interview data.


These characteristics will shape the way we design our services, data flow, and interactions with external platforms like InterviewLogger,MindComputeScheduler, and MyMindComputeProfile.

## Rationale

### Why These Characteristics?

1. **Security**

   - The system handles confidential candidate information, interview schedules, and interviewer rankings.

   - Compliance with data protection regulations requires strict access controls and secure data transmission.

2. **Performance**

   - Chatbot interactions demand real-time responsiveness to enhance the recruiter experience.

   - Interview scheduling should operate efficiently with minimal processing overhead.

   - Analytics processing, though asynchronous, should not cause significant delays in report generation.

3. **Extensibility**

   - The system should accommodate future enhancements, such as AI-powered interview recommendations or predictive analytics, without major architectural changes.

   - New integrations with additional third-party systems should be seamless.

4. **Maintainability**

   - The adoption of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and microservices ensures modularity.

   - Clear separation of concerns simplifies debugging, testing, and code updates.

5. **Resilience**

   - As an event-driven system, failures in one service should not bring down the entire platform.

   - Retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and fallback strategies will be employed to ensure graceful degradation.


## Alternatives Considered

1. **Prioritizing Scalability Over Other Factors**

   - Rejected since our system does not have a high load requirement; premature optimization for scalability would introduce unnecessary complexity.

2. **Simplifying Architecture with a Monolith**

   - While a monolith could improve performance initially, it would hinder maintainability and extensibility in the long run.


## Consequences

- These characteristics will serve as guiding principles for technical decisions, implementation patterns, and trade-offs.

- Certain trade-offs may be made, such as preferring security over raw performance in data-sensitive operations.

- The system will be designed with future growth in mind but without unnecessary over-engineering.
