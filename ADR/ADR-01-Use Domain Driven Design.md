## **Context**

MindCompute’ interview scheduling system requires a robust and maintainable architecture that aligns with business complexities. Given the need for **clear domain boundaries, extensibility, and adaptability**, we have chosen **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** as the guiding principle for structuring the system.

Key challenges that led to this decision:

- **Complex Business Logic**: The system must handle intricate interview scheduling workflows, prioritization, and integration with multiple external systems (InterviewLogger, MindComputeScheduler, MyMindComputeProfile, etc.).

- **Scalability & Maintainability**: As new features and integrations are required, the system should be easy to extend without major refactoring.

- **Decoupling & Clear Boundaries**: Different subsystems such as **Interview Management System, Chatbot, and Recruitment Analytics** need well-defined ownership and separation of concerns.

## **Decision**

We will implement **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to model our system effectively. This includes:

1. **Defining Bounded Contexts**:

   - **Interview Management System**: Manages interviews, interviewer selection, and scheduling.

   - **Chatbot System**: Helps recruiters find interviewers and assists in scheduling.

   - **Recruitment Analytics**: Provides insights into interviewer activity, scheduling efficiency, and bottlenecks.

2. **Using Aggregates & Entities**:

   - **Interviewer Aggregate**: Includes interviewer details, availability, and past interview records.

   - **Interview Aggregate**: Tracks interview status, feedback, and scheduling metadata.

   - **Recruiter Aggregate**: Manages recruiter interactions and candidate data enrichment.

3. **Applying Domain Events & Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**:

   - **Scheduling Events**: Interview scheduled, rescheduled, canceled.

   - **Analytics Events**: Interview completion, interviewer load updates.

   - **Chatbot Events**: Interviewer recommendation requests, scheduling inquiries.

4. **Ensuring Domain-Driven Communication**:

   - Services interact via **domain-specific APIs and event-based messaging**.

   - External integrations (InterviewLogger, MindComputeScheduler, MyMindComputeProfile) follow **anti-corruption layers** to keep our domain pure.

## **Consequences**

### **Pros**

✅ **Better Modularity** – Each service has clear ownership, making it easier to scale and maintain.
✅ **Improved Code Maintainability** – Business logic is encapsulated within domain models, making changes easier.
✅ **Business Alignment** – The system models **real-world processes and concepts**, helping both developers and domain experts communicate effectively.
✅ **Flexibility for Future Enhancements** – New business rules and functionalities can be added with minimal disruption.

### **Cons**

❌ **Learning Curve** – Team members unfamiliar with DDD need time to understand its principles.
❌ **Potential Overhead** – DDD requires additional effort in defining domains, events, and maintaining boundaries.

## **Alternatives Considered**

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Rejected due to **tight coupling, scalability challenges, and lack of clear domain separation**.

2. **Traditional Layered Architecture**: Did not align with **event-driven nature** and **complex domain modeling needs**.

## **Decision Outcome**

We will **proceed with DDD** as the foundational design approach, ensuring proper training and best practices to maximize its benefits.
